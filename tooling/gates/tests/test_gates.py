Two kinds of assertion, both required by spec §4:

  * **Per-gate, both directions** — every registered gate fires on its failing
    fixture and is silent on its clean one.
  * **Harness behaviour** — BROKEN is reachable in each of its three ways, FAIL
    is distinct from PASS, and SKIP is never a pass.

The second group is the one that proves the harness itself can fail. Maith's own
first exit-code verification was vacuous because nothing asserted the check
could fire; these tests exist so that failure cannot recur here silently.
