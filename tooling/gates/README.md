# Tier-0 integrity gates

Ports the fixture-gate pattern from Maith's `tooling/gates/` (itself ported from
PleaNP). The authority is
[`docs/reference/TEST_VALIDATION_SPEC.md`](../../docs/reference/TEST_VALIDATION_SPEC.md)
§3–§4; this file is the operator's reference.

## Why this exists

Four failures in one session shared one shape: **a plausible-looking artifact
produced by a process whose correctness was never checked.**

- a multiplicative-correction layer that could not fire, reported as "no
  significant pairs"
- a positive control that activated neither of its intended feature groups
- an isolate score of 0.996 computed entirely from cases where nothing moved
- a per-feature causal claim at 36% SAE reconstruction error

Each read as a result. None was. Ephapse's discipline had been prose in
`MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` and `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, enforced by agent diligence —
which is exactly the enforcement that failed four times. These gates turn as
much of that prose as is mechanically checkable into code.

## The two tiers, never merged

- **Tier 0** — no model load, no torch, no network. Schema, text, and
  cross-reference checks over artifacts. Runs in CI. 29 of the 37 gates (see
  the count history in `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md` § Validation layer — this number
  has moved twice since the harness landed).
- **Tier 1** — requires loading the probed model. The detector-validity gates.

**A tier-0 pass is not "gate passed."** Maith's formulation, adopted verbatim:

> Treating a grep pass as a gate pass is itself an integrity hole.

A green tier-0 run means the artifacts are internally consistent and their
evidence is present. It does **not** mean a detector measures what it claims —
that is tier 1, and beyond tier 1 it is the human's.

## The one rule that makes the rest work

**Every gate ships a fixture that makes it fail, and the runner proves it does.**

`run_all.py` asserts, per gate:

1. it is **silent on the clean fixture**, and
2. it **fires on its failing fixture**.

If (2) cannot be demonstrated — no failing fixture registered, fixture missing,
or the gate stays silent on it — the gate is reported **`BROKEN`** and the run
fails. A gate that cannot fail is not a check.

This is not ceremony. Maith's first exit-code verification was itself vacuous: a
string anchor silently missed and the "test" passed against a broken scanner.
The same thing happened while building this harness: G-R1's infrastructure
regex matched the phrase *"does NOT declare itself an infrastructure file"* in
its own failing fixture, silently exempting it from the full header. The runner
reported `BROKEN`, which is exactly the signal that rule exists to produce.

## Usage

```bash
python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py              # all gates, human report
python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py --json       # machine-readable
python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py --gate G-R1  # one gate
python3 tooling/gates/tests/test_gates.py     # the harness's own tests
```

Exit codes: `0` when every gate is `PASS`; `1` when any gate is `FAIL` or
`BROKEN`. That is the contract CI consumes.

## CI (issue #13)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request to `dev`. It is
the point at which the validation layer stops depending on an agent remembering
to run it.

| Job | What it runs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `gates` | `run_all.py`, then removes a failing fixture and requires `BROKEN` | Proves the fixture rule is still live, not just asserted in prose |
| `tests` | `pytest tooling/gates/tests/`, the auditor suite, the hub-sweep suite, a foreign-cwd re-run, and a mutation check | Proves the checks can fail — a suite that cannot go red is not a test |
| `summary` | States the limit of a green run | So a green check cannot be read as "validated" |

**What does not run here, and why.** No torch, no model, no GPU, no secrets, and
`requirements.txt` is deliberately *not* installed — installing the ML stack
would break the tier-0 guarantee that this suite is cheap and deterministic
(issue #13's method constraint). `pytest` is the one package the workflow
installs, because `tooling/gates/tests/` is a pytest suite.

One test is **skipped** in CI: `test_g_p2_is_right_in_both_directions_on_strings_vs_ids`
downloads the real tokenizer, which is tier 1. It is marked with
`pytest.importorskip` so it skips visibly (`-rs` reports it) rather than failing
the job or silently vanishing. Spec §10 Q2 proposes the fix — commit the token-id
sets as evidence and re-verify only when they change — which would bring it into
tier 0. Until then it is an unenforced check, recorded rather than hidden.

**Network needs.** G-E7 and G-M1/G-M2 read the committed issue-state cache
(`tests/fixture_issue_state.json`); they do not fetch, so no job needs network.
G-E6 reads the committed `findings.highwater` mark rather than history, which is
why `fetch-depth: 1` suffices (spec §10 Q4).

**A green run here is necessary, not sufficient.** It means the artifacts are
internally consistent, every gate can be shown to fire, and the code-level tests
pass. It does **not** mean any detector measures what it claims — that is tier 1,
and beyond tier 1 it is the human's.

### What wiring CI immediately caught

Adding the workflow ran the suite for the first time, and three defects fell out
that no review had seen:

- **`findings.jsonl` record 5 carried an undeclared key** (`input_disjointness`),
  so G-E1 was firing on the repo's own committed evidence. Fixed by adding the
  key to `KNOWN_EXTENSIONS` — the addition the gate's own message asks for.
- **`findings.highwater` was stale** (5 records, mark 4). G-E6 named its remedy;
  the mark is now 5.
- **`test_hub_sweep.py` was cwd-dependent** — it passed from `/tmp` and failed
  from the repo root, because it passed `Path(".")` where a `tmp_path` belonged.
  It only ever "passed" because it had never been run from the repo root.

Each is the same shape: a plausible artifact whose correctness was never checked.
That is the case for the workflow, made by the workflow.

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PASS` | Silent on its clean fixture **and** fires on its failing fixture. |
| `FAIL` | Fired on the clean fixture — the gate is wrong or the fixture is dirty. |
| `BROKEN` | Its ability to fail could not be demonstrated: no failing fixture registered, fixture missing, the gate stayed silent on it, or it **raised**. **Not a pass.** |
| `SKIP` | Fires on its failing fixture (so it *is* a check), but part of its input was unavailable on the clean side. Reported with the reason. **Never a pass** — the exit code stays non-zero unless `--allow-skip` is given. |

Two rules that follow from the incident history:

- **A gate that raises is `BROKEN`, not a crash.** An exception means the gate
  cannot be shown to work, which is what `BROKEN` says. The runner catches it and
  carries the exception text into the report. (Learned building G-E7, whose
  `.relative_to(REPO)` raised on a relocated path and took the suite down.)
- **`SKIP` must not mask a reportable violation.** G-E7 checks `run_id` format
  (offline, always reportable) and issue state (needs a cache). A malformed
  `run_id` returns `FAIL` even when the cache is missing; only the *unavailable*
  half produces `SKIP`.

## Layout

```
tooling/gates/
  README.md              — this file
  run_all.py             — the runner: discovery, both-directions contract, exit code
  validate_*.py          — gate modules; each self-registers via register()
  tests/
    conftest.py          — puts tooling/gates/ on sys.path
    test_gates.py        — per-gate both-directions + harness-behaviour tests
    fixtures/
      <gate>/{clean,failing}_*.py
```

## Adding a gate

1. Write `validate_<area>.py` beside `run_all.py`.
2. Implement `check(path) -> list[str]` (empty list = pass; deterministic; no
   network, no model, no LLM).
3. Call `register(Gate(id=..., name=..., tier=0, check=..., clean_fixture=...,
   failing_fixture=..., traces_to=...))`. **Both fixtures are mandatory.**
4. Make the failing fixture a **near miss**, not an obviously-broken file. A
   gate that only fires on an empty file satisfies the letter of the fixture
   rule and none of its purpose.
5. `python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py --gate <ID>` must report `PASS`, and
   deleting the failing fixture must report `BROKEN`.

## Gate inventory


| Gate | Checks | Traces to | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G-R1** | Experiment header completeness — six fields, or the documented three for an infrastructure file | `experiments/README.md`; spec §3 | **wired** |
| **G-R2** | Experiment model id is an authorized target (fails closed) | DEC-014; spec §1 defect #1 | **wired** |
| **G-R3** | Every requirement pinned, or an inline `# unpinned-by-policy: <rationale>` exemption | `requirements.txt` header; spec §3 | **wired** |
| **G-R5** | Every `experiments/*.py` has a run-log row | spec §1 defect #2 | **wired** |
| **G-E1** | Findings schema — parses, required keys present, no undeclared keys | `findings.jsonl` header | **wired** |
| **G-E2** | `null_model`, `correction`, `n` non-empty — the evidence bar | issue #4 DoD | **wired** |
| **G-E6** | Append-only — record count >= committed high-water mark | `findings.jsonl` header; spec §10 Q4 | **wired** |
| **G-E7** | `issue` cites a closed-done issue; `run_id` matches format | workflow § Run-ids | **wired** (SKIPs without the issue cache) |
| **G-E9** | A `flagged` finding cannot rest on an `instrument-failed` outcome — the join between `findings.jsonl` `verdict` and the ledger `outcome` | program spec §3.2; issue #87 | **wired** |
| **G-P2** | Two prompt sets share zero tokenizer ids; intersection size *and contents* reported | DEC-011; spec §3 | **wired** |
| **G-P4** | No prompt string appears in both sets | spec §3 | **wired** (same module) |
| **G-M1** | Exactly one `status:` and one `kind:` label per OPEN issue, from the registered vocabulary | program spec §7 | **wired** (SKIPs without the cache) |
| **G-M2** | An `status:available` issue has no OPEN blocker | program spec §4; workflow §1a | **wired** (SKIPs without edges) |

### Label-state protection: three failure modes, three mechanisms

Three label-state defects appeared in one session while filing #29–#34. They are
**different classes**, and only one is a gate's job:

| Failure | What it looked like | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Invalid mutation** | Both `status:available` and `status:blocked-needs-input` set on one issue | **G-M1** detects it; `issue_state.py set-status` makes it unreachable |
| **Dependency violation** | #32/#33 `available` while their blocker #31 was OPEN — cardinality correct, so G-M1 is silent | **G-M2** detects it; `issue_state.py block` enforces it at edge-creation |
| **Omission** | The #31 dependency edge was never created, so there was nothing to violate | **No gate can see this** — an absent edge is indistinguishable from a task with no dependencies. Mitigated only by `block` being the sanctioned path to add one. |

**Detection is partial; prevention is the rest.** `tooling/program/issue_state.py`
is the *preventer*: it computes the target label set, validates it **before**
mutating, and applies the whole set in one `gh issue edit`, so the two-status
state cannot be produced. `set-status` removes every status label and adds
exactly the requested one in the same invocation.

**The vacancy guard, and why G-M2 needs one.** G-M2's first version reported
**PASS while checking nothing**: a refresh via `gh issue list` cannot read
dependencies, so `blocked_by` was empty for every issue and the gate found no
violations in a graph it never saw. A green result that cannot come out red is
not a result. G-M2 now returns **SKIP** when no cached issue carries any edge,
and a test (`test_real_cache_dependency_graph_is_not_vacuous`) fails if a future
refresh hollows the graph out again. `refresh` reads `blocked_by` via GraphQL —
31 real edges at the time of writing.

## Running the program-level checks

```bash
python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py --gate G-M1     # the authoritative gate run
python3 tooling/program/issue_state.py audit     # both gates, pre-commit
python3 tooling/program/issue_state.py refresh   # rewrite the committed cache
python3 tooling/program/issue_state.py set-status 30 status:claimed
python3 tooling/program/issue_state.py block 32 31
```

`audit` exists so a session can check its own work before committing — the
cheapest place to catch a violation, and the place where the three defects above
would have been caught.

Spec §3 lists the remaining 17; issues #12–#14, #16, #19, #20, #22 add them.
Each must trace to a documented concern — the suite asserts `traces_to` is
non-empty for every registered gate.

### The shared model target

`tooling/gates/target_model.txt` is the **single machine-readable source** for
the authorized probed-model id(s). G-R2 reads it. `docs/decisions/LOG.md` is prose
and deriving a model id from it is brittle, so the gate never parses the log — a
DEC that authorizes a new model adds a line to `target_model.txt` *and* records
the DEC.

> **Correction (issue #12).** Issue #11's method constraint asked for "one
> machine-readable source shared with #12". That reference does not resolve: #12
> is dependency pinning over `requirements.txt`, which has no model dimension, so
> its gate (`validate_deps.py`) reads no target file. The target source is read
> by G-R2 alone. Recorded rather than silently ignored, because a doc claiming a
> consumer that does not exist is the same class of drift G-R4 (#20) exists to
> catch.

### Findings worth keeping

Three real defects surfaced while wiring these gates, each caught by running the
gate rather than by review:

- **The infrastructure pattern matched nothing.** `experiments/README.md` names
  `sandbox-baseline-*` and `latency-*`, but every file is date-prefixed
  (`2026-09-18-latency-vs-batch.py`), so a plain `startswith` never applied. G-R1
  reported both infrastructure files as full-header violations. The pattern is
  now matched against the filename with the date stripped.
- **G-R2 did not fail closed.** It treated any non-empty `Model:` line as a
  determination, so a header reading `(unstated)` passed silently — the exact
  hole the fail-closed rule exists to close. A header now counts only if it
  yields an id-shaped token.
- **G-E6 caught real drift.** A sibling session appended a fourth record without
  raising `findings.highwater`; the gate fired with the exact fix in its message.

### Two spec §10 questions resolved while building G-E1/E6

**Q3 — is the gate or the header prose authoritative for the schema?** The gate,
but with one deliberate deviation recorded here: **G-E1 does not reject unknown
keys outright.** The committed records carry `kind`, `injection`, `result`, and
`note`, which the header prose never listed. Rejecting them would retroactively
invalidate the project's only recorded evidence. Instead a fixed `REQUIRED` set
must be present *and* every extra key must appear in `KNOWN_EXTENSIONS`. The
required-key list is identical to the header's, so there is no divergence to
reconcile; the extensions list is the single place the gate is more permissive
than the prose.

**Q4 — does G-E6 need git history?** No. The clone is shallow, so the gate reads
a committed integer, `findings.highwater`, and requires the current record count
to be `>=` it. Raising the mark is a separate reviewable commit. Its limitation
is stated in the gate: deleting a line fires, but *editing* a line in place does
not — count-based checking cannot see that without history.

### The experiment gates are red on the current tree — on purpose

`python3 tooling/gates/validate_experiments.py` exits **non-zero**, naming 13
findings across 13 files: two loading `pythia-160m` against the DEC-014 target,
seven lacking the full header, two absent from the run log. That is the expected
state for issue #11 and the evidence the gates work. **Repairing the artifacts is
#15, not this task.** A test asserts these gates stay red until #15, so if they
ever go green the reason is surfaced rather than silently accepted.

## What these gates cannot do

They are **partial by construction, and say so.** They are text, schema, and
cross-reference checks over artifacts. They cannot tell whether a detector is
measuring what it claims — that is tier 1's job (G-D3–G-D5), and beyond tier 1
it is the human's. A tier-0 suite that passes is evidence that the *paperwork is
consistent*, nothing more.
