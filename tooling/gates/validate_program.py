"""G-M1, G-M2 — program label-state gates (issue #30).

Tier 0. Reads the committed issue-state cache only; never the network.

| ID   | Check |
|------|-------|
| G-M1 | Exactly one `status:` and exactly one `kind:` label per OPEN issue |
| G-M2 | Dependency coherence — an `status:available` issue has no OPEN blocker |

WHY TWO GATES AND NOT ONE. G-M1 alone would not have caught the failure that
motivated this work. Three label-state defects appeared in a single session:

  1. **Invalid mutation.** Filing #29-#34 set *both* `status:available` and
     `status:blocked-needs-input` on the same issue. G-M1 catches this.
  2. **Dependency violation.** #32 and #33 were marked `status:available` while
     their declared blocker #31 was OPEN. Their label *cardinality* was correct —
     one status each — so G-M1 is silent. Only a check that reads the dependency
     graph sees it. That is G-M2.
  3. **Omission.** The #31 dependency link was never created at all, so #32/#33
     had no `blocked_by` edge and nothing to violate. **No gate catches this**,
     because absence of an edge is indistinguishable from a task with no
     dependencies. It is a filing-protocol defect, addressed by the setter in
     `tooling/program/issue_state.py` and by the spec's task map being the
     authority for what edges should exist.

So a gate is *detection*, and detection is partial. The same session produced a
defect no gate can see, which is why this issue also lands a *preventer*.

THE CACHE. `tests/fixture_issue_state.json`, extended with two fields per issue:

    {"28": {"state": "CLOSED", "done": true,
            "labels": ["status:done", "kind:protocol"],
            "blocked_by": []}}

Entries whose key starts with `_` are metadata and ignored. The `state`/`done`
fields are G-E7's and must not change; `labels` and `blocked_by` are additive.

Both gates return SKIP — never pass — when the cache is absent or lacks issues,
following the G-E7 precedent exactly.

    Rule 1 (`outcome` requires `results` or `findings`) was satisfiable by a

    an outcome could rest on an absent artifact or cite a finding line outside
    `findings.jsonl` (issue #85). This gate asserts the mechanical half of the
    fix — existence of each `results` path, and range of each `findings` line.

    `path` is the fixture **directory** holding `ledger.jsonl` and the

    to that directory, so the gate never reads the live repo file whose record
