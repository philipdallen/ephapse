"""Tier-0 gate runner (issue #9).

Discovers every registered gate, runs each against the committed fixture tree,
aggregates the exit code, and prints a report carrying the gate id.

**Tier 0 only.** No torch, no model, no network, no LLM. Deterministic file
inspection. See docs/reference/TEST_VALIDATION_SPEC.md §3, §4, §6.

THE ONE NON-OBVIOUS RULE (spec §4, Maith's lesson)

    A gate with no registered failing fixture is reported BROKEN and fails
    the run.

This is the whole point of the harness. Maith's first exit-code verification
was itself vacuous — a string anchor silently missed and the "test" passed
against a broken scanner. The fix is to make the fixture rule *mechanical*: a
gate cannot be trusted unless the harness can prove the gate fires.

So `run_all.py` asserts two things per gate:

  1. it PASSES on the clean fixture, and
  2. it FIRES on its failing fixture.

If (2) cannot be demonstrated — because no failing fixture is registered, or the
fixture is missing, or the gate stays silent on it — the gate is BROKEN. A gate
that cannot fail is not a check.

Exit codes: 0 when every gate is PASS; 1 when any gate is BROKEN or FAIL.

Usage:
    python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py               # run everything, print report
    python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py --json        # machine-readable
    python3 tooling/gates/run_all.py --gate G-R1   # one gate
