"""G-R1, G-R2, G-R5 — experiment-artifact gates (issue #11).

Over `experiments/*.py` and `experiments/README.md`. These are the gates for the
two mechanical defects from the repo's first two sessions: a file loading a
model the target DEC does not authorize, and a run log that omits rows.

| ID   | Check |
|------|-------|
| G-R1 | Six mandatory header fields for hypothesis-test files; the documented three-field exemption for infrastructure files |
| G-R2 | Model id matches the authorized target unless a DEC authorizes otherwise — read from one machine-readable source, not hardcoded |
| G-R5 | Every `experiments/*.py` has a row in the `experiments/README.md` run log |

TWO FALSE-NEGATIVE HOLES CLOSED (issue #24). Both were reachable by editing a
docstring, and both let a violating file pass:

* **Hole 2 — the exemption was self-granted by prose.** `_is_infra` accepted a
  line-leading "infrastructure file" declaration from *any* file, so a
  hypothesis-test file could drop `Null`/`Correction` by adding one sentence.
  The exemption is now **filename-based**; a bare declaration no longer excuses
  a file. The declaration is still recorded and cross-checked, but it cannot
  grant the exemption on its own. Closing this hole is what exposes the real
  tree's `gen_cross_domain.py`, which relied on the prose route; the correct
  response is a header, not a new exemption pattern — whether a genuinely
  infrastructure file belongs in the enumerated set is #16's README/exemption
  reconciliation.
* **Hole 1 — no attribution escape.** `check_model_authorized` flagged any
  non-target id unconditionally, so #15 could not honestly repair the tree: it
  had to falsify the superseded 160M measurements or delete them. A non-target
  id is now accepted when the file carries a line-leading
  `**Supersedes: <decision-id>**` naming the decision that *is* the model
  decision (read from `target_model.txt`, not hardcoded). An unrelated DEC
  citation does not qualify — the earlier bare `DEC-<n>` draft failed exactly
  that way, per #24's method constraint.

Two entry points, deliberately:

    python3 tooling/gates/validate_experiments.py     # over the REAL tree
    (or) run via run_all.py                            # over FIXTURES

The first is issue #11's Definition of Done: it must exit non-zero on the tree
as of #11, naming the files. The second is the harness contract: a fixture
directory that passes and one that fails. Repairing the real artifacts is #15.

**G-R2 fails closed.** A file whose model cannot be determined is flagged, not
skipped. "Cannot determine" is exactly the state in which a substitution would
go unnoticed, so accepting it would defeat the gate.

THE MODEL SOURCE (the "single machine-readable source" the issue asks for).
`docs/decisions/LOG.md` is prose and deriving a model id from it is brittle, so
the authorized target is declared in `tooling/gates/target_model.txt`. That file
is the one place this gate reads the target from. Issue #11's method constraint
phrased this as "one machine-readable source shared with #12", but that reference
does not resolve — #12 is dependency pinning over `requirements.txt` and has no
model dimension, so `validate_deps.py` reads no target file. A DEC authorizing a
different model adds a line to `target_model.txt` *and* records the DEC; the gate
does not parse the decision log.
