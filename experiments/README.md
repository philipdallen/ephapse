# experiments

One file per experiment, named `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.py` (or `.ipynb`).

Every experiment file starts with a header comment carrying six mandatory
fields. Copy this block verbatim and fill it in:

```python
"""<one-line summary>

**Model:** <exact model id>, <dtype>, <device>.
**Inputs:** <what prompt sets are used, and where they come from>.
**Question:** <what is being tested, in one sentence>.
**Null:** <the null model the result is compared against>.
**Correction:** <the multiplicity correction applied>.
**Issue:** #<number> (<context>).
"""
```

A file missing any of the six fields is not runnable as evidence. The rule is
enforced by `tooling/gates/validate_experiments.py` (G-R1) — that gate's rule
definition is the single source of truth; this section describes it and is tied
to it, it does not replace it.

---

## Infrastructure / baseline measurements

The exemption is an **enumerable filename pattern**, never an intent. A file is
exempt when its name — with any leading `YYYY-MM-DD-` stripped — matches one of
the patterns enumerated in `INFRA_PATTERNS` in
`tooling/gates/validate_experiments.py`:

- `sandbox-baseline-*`
- `latency-*`

Those files measure the environment rather than testing a scientific question,
so they drop `Null` and `Correction` and carry the three reduced fields —
**Model**, **Question**, **Issue**:

```python
"""<one-line summary>

**Model:** <exact model id>, <dtype>, <device>.
**Question:** <what the environment measurement establishes>.
**Issue:** #<number> (<context>).
"""
```

Their results land in `docs/reference/SANDBOX_BASELINE.md` rather than
`findings.jsonl`.

A file cannot grant itself the exemption by describing itself as
infrastructure: a line-leading declaration is ignored, because the exemption is
a function of the filename alone. A hypothesis-test file that claims the
exemption is judged against the full six-field rule and reported — the intent
phrasing ("whose purpose is measuring the environment") is deliberately not the
rule, since no agent can apply it consistently.

## Run log

| Date | File | Issue | What it measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-18 | `2026-09-18-sandbox-baseline-hooked.py` | #1 | Peak RSS for a hooked run (`run_with_cache`) vs bare forward pass; cache size per prompt |
| 2026-09-18 | `2026-09-18-latency-vs-batch.py` | #1 | Amortized latency across batch sizes; resolves the 207 ms (batch 1) vs 21 ms (batch 64) discrepancy |
| 2026-09-18 | `2026-09-18-toolchain-neuronpedia-crosscheck.py` | #2 | End-to-end TransformerLens + SAELens, cross-checked against Neuronpedia's hosted copy of the same feature |
| 2026-09-18 | `2026-09-18-detector-positive-control.py` | #5 | Injected-correlation positive control: detector recovery vs injection rate, permutation null, negative control. **PASSES** on the max-statistic test; BH-FDR layer found broken (DEC-016) |
| 2026-09-18 | `2026-09-18-injected-positive-control-detector-validation.py` | #5 | Detector recovery vs injected-correlation rate at pythia-70m; **detector recovers 0.87 at rate 0.20 vs 0.00 for a naive raw-co-occurrence baseline**. Four prior runs (same file, preserved as `*-results-initial.json`, `-v2`, `-v3`, `-v4`) returned zero for control-side and test-side reasons documented in DEC-019 |
| 2026-09-19 | `2026-09-18-intervention-positive-control.py` | #7 | Interchange-intervention harness (ablation). **Known-positive passes 5/5** (full residual swap moves the target); cumulative ablation ladder **MOVES 5/5**; but **0/50 single features** exceed the cause threshold — per-feature claims are inconclusive at this scale, not negative (DEC-020). SAE reconstruction rel. error 0.362 |
| 2026-09-19 | `2026-09-19-interchange-intervention-positive-control.py` | #7 | Same task, two intervention **sites** x two metric **scales**. At the country token (logit scale) **mean Cause 0.75**, interference control 0/240, but mean Isolate 0.208 (3/4 features fail isolation). At the final token (probability scale, matching DEC-020) the effect is 8e-4 — invisible. Reconciles the two opposite #7 results: site and scale change the answer (DEC-025) |
| 2026-09-19 | `2026-09-19-diagnose-saturation.py` | #6 | Feature firing-rate distribution; found 32764/32768 features firing on zero prompts under a pooled threshold |
| 2026-09-19 | `2026-09-19-diagnose-length-dependence.py` | #6 | Feature activity vs prompt length; passages give 2.2x the usable-feature pool of bare prompts |
| 2026-09-19 | `2026-09-19-paraphrase-robustness.py` | #6 | Verbal-vs-symbolic bridging. Matched 6 survivors vs null 0 (weak but real); paraphrase 17 |
| 2026-09-19 | `2026-09-19-detector-positive-control-rerun.py` | #5 | #5 re-run with per-feature thresholds. **Does NOT replicate** — max-NPMI cannot separate the injected pair from noise |
| 2026-09-19 | `gen_cross_domain.py` | #3 | Generate 120 cooking / 120 astronomy passages with a **mechanically verified zero-token-id intersection** (separate vocab *and* glue tokens); median 18-19 tokens |
| 2026-09-19 | `2026-09-19-cross-domain-probe.py` | #3 | Cross-domain co-activation probe. **Positive control recovers** (planted token, best z 11.30 vs cutoff 4.47); real run **0 survivors** (best z 3.10 vs 4.41) — a clean, interpretable null. Retires the raw co-activation-rate family-max cutoff (DEC-027) |

Note: the first two are the pre-existing exceptions to the naming convention
above (they omit the `null`/`correction` headers deliberately). Future files
should carry the full header.

## Target model and SAE (settled, issue #2)

**Use `pythia-70m-deduped` with `pythia-70m-deduped-res-sm`** (7 hooks,
resid_pre + resid_post L0–L5). This is not a preference — it is the only
Pythia pair that exists in SAELens. There is no Pythia-160M release. See
DEC-014 and `docs/reference/SANDBOX_BASELINE.md`.

Working values from the verified run:

```python
MODEL      = "pythia-70m-deduped"          # TransformerLens
SAE_RELEASE = "pythia-70m-deduped-res-sm"  # SAELens
SAE_ID      = "blocks.3.hook_resid_post"   # d_in=512, d_sae=32768
NP_MODEL    = "pythia-70m-deduped"         # Neuronpedia
NP_SAE      = "3-res-sm"
```

Decoder directions come from local `sae.W_dec`. Neuronpedia does **not**
serve vectors (DEC-015).
| 2026-09-22 | `2026-09-22-comparator-baselines.py` | #37 | DEC-034 comparators on the #6 corpus: SAE bridge statistic beside difference-in-means and linear-probe AUROC, on matched / shuffled-null / paraphrase arms. SAE stays the primary reading; comparators are a sensitivity check |
| 2026-09-27 | `2026-09-27-activation-atlas.py` | #82 | Feature-response atlas: pythia-70m-deduped layer-3 residual matrix rendered to PNG (+ co-activation map) with provenance, for the rorschach handoff. Positive control **PASSES** (injected block recovered in feature space). No statistic computed — a record, not a finding |
```
python3 experiments/2026-09-22-comparator-baselines.py
```

Records a `kind: comparator_baselines` result object (not a `findings.jsonl`
line — that is the flagged-event log and its write belongs to a detector run,
#3) shaped like a finding: `n`, `geometry`, and an `arms` list, one entry per
arm, each carrying the SAE bridge reading, both supervised AUROCs, and a
bridge-shaped statistic for the probe direction so all three substrates are
directly comparable (G-C5).

Headline (n=200, pythia-70m-deduped, `blocks.3.hook_resid_post`):

| arm | SAE best / cutoff / survivors | diff-in-means AUROC | probe AUROC | probe bridge best / cutoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| matched | 0.035 / 0.015 / 6 | 0.756 | 0.585 | 0.50 / 0.485 |
| shuffled-null | 0.010 / 0.015 / 0 | 0.569 | 0.600 | 0.48 / 0.485 |
| paraphrase | 0.050 / 0.015 / 17 | 0.407 | 0.448 | 0.23 / 0.33 |

Neither substrate detects a paraphrase-invariant bridge: the probe is at
chance on the paraphrase arm (AUROC 0.448, bridge 0.23 below its own 0.33
cutoff), so the null is not an SAE artifact. The matched SAE numbers
reproduce #6 exactly (63 selected, best 0.035, 6 survivors), which is the
cross-run comparability check. The probe is **not** a substrate
replacement: it yields a direction, not an enumerable decoder-backed
feature, so this is a sensitivity check on the detector, not a swap.

Geometry: raw hook basis; cosine similarity is not used anywhere in this
run, so the PRIOR_ART §9 concern (concepts are not linear in the raw basis)
does not apply to a threshold here.
